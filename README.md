# Functional component

Write a functional component that wraps a text input element.
  - the text input shouldn't commit the user's input value immediately (i.e. as the user types)
  - instead, it should commit the value when the user presses enter or leaves the input field
  - if the user presses the escape key then we should rollback to the last-entered value
